      <h2>About me:</h2>
      <p>I am Saif Khan, a dedicated software developer proficient in a range of programming languages, including Python, Java, C, and JavaScript. My academic journey is 
        enriched with coursework in systems programming and computer architecture. Professionally, I had the privilege to contribute as a Software Intern at Apple Inc.,
         where I closely collaborated with diverse teams to craft Python-based features, ensuring they met Apple's high standards. Beyond my professional engagements,
          I've taken on a leadership role as the Director of Technology for the Pakistani Student Association at the University of Davis, California. My enthusiasm 
          for innovation is evident in projects like the Aircraft Cargo Management System and the Matrix Determinant Calculator. Moreover, my stint as a Teacher
           Assistant has enabled me to understand the interplay between technology and education, underscoring my commitment to user-focused design.</p>
